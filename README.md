## Part-Time Nerd, Full-Time Adventurer & Art-Lover 🌍🎨

### About Me

As an undergraduate student, I’m passionate about learning something new
every day—whether it’s planned or entirely random! These days, I’m freshly diving
into computer science and its many fields, with the hope of making my mark in
the industry. My goal is to grow both personally and professionally,
one step at a time.

### Interests

🎨 **Art**: Passionate about all forms of creativity and self-expression  

🤝 **The World and Humanity**: Forever curious about the interplay between
human beings and their environment  

💻🧠 **Psychology & Computer Science**: Fascinated by the intersection of
technology and the human mind  

### Fun Fact

Years ago, I had the chance to study **_computer engineering_**, and honestly,
it seemed like the **_last_** career I’d consider. Fast forward to today—here I am,
diving into it bit by bit, starting with GitHub.
Destiny sure has a funny way of humbling us, doesn’t it? 🤭
